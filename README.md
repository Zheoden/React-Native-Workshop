# React Native app from scratch with Typescript

Hi everyone!

On the following workshop we are going to learn how to create a `react-native` app from scratch. Also, we will be learning about `navigation`, `state management`, `storage caching` and `localization` and how to set them up in our project. We must not forget about `code quality`, so we will be talking about it too.

Source code used for this workshop can be found on `code` folder, presentation files on `ppt` and more detailed info on `docs`.

Remember taking the self-assessment test before and after the workshop and if anything comes up or you just want to send us some feedback, you can post it on SOUTHWORKS' Stack Overflow page using the`react-native` tag (or submiting it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/c/southworks/tags/react-native)). 

Happy coding!

## Overview of the app

We will list below some issues that come along while developing mobile apps and our proposed solution:
- Browsing through menu and other screens (i.e. each product details screen)
    - [Navigation](./docs/navigation/README.md)
- Quick startup of the app with user selected configuration
    - [Storage Caching](./docs/storage/README.md)
- Store cart state and access and/or modify it on any screen/component
    - [State Management using Redux](./docs/state-management/README.md)
- Adapt prices according to user's region
    - [Localization and internationalization](./docs/loc-and-i18n/README.md)
